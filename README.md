resources and tips for Windows 10 Power Users 


Scoop
    
    https://scoop.sh/#/
    
    Windows 11 command line installer

        Powershell: iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex
        Command Shell: scoop install "*"

Powertoys

    https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys
    
    Plenty of configuration tools to choose from. My favorite from this is the
    Fancy Zone tools which lets you customize windows layouts. My only gripe is
    that it doesn't allow a shortcut (I believe) to automatically sort your
    current open windos to the default custom layouts.

Windows Grid

    http://windowgrid.net/
    
    Another tool that allows for custom windows layouts. While Power Toys provide
    a more static custom layout, Grid allows for a more dynamic off the cuff type
    of resizing.
    
NVIDIA Inspector

    https://github.com/Orbmu2k/nvidiaProfileInspector/releases
    
    Allows for indept custom graphic settings for gaming purposes.
    
Sidebar Diagnostics

    https://github.com/ArcadeRenegade/SidebarDiagnostics
    
    Provides a static graphical presentation of your computer stats (think htop).
    
DeBloat Windows10

    https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10
    
    Powershell scripts that debloats Win10 from pre-packaged software that you
    will almost never use.
